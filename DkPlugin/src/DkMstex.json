	"Description"	: "The proposed approach incorporates three methods for MultiSpectral Text Extraction. First, a rough foreground estimation is performed by thresholding a cleaned channel. This rough foreground estimation is used in a second step to train an Adaptive Coherence Estimator (ACE). The ACE detects a spectral subspace which enhances ink while the contrast of other elements (e.g. stains) is reduced.  Finally we combine the cleaned channel with the mean and standard deviation images and perform a GrabCut. The GrabCut is guided by a mask which is based on the results of the ACE.",
